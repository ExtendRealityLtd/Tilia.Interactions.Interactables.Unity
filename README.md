## Introduction

A collection of patterns for providing ways of interacting with [Unity] objects within spatial scenes. The package contains two core concepts:

* Interactors - The ability of something to initiate interacting (e.g. a controller or a hand)
* Interactables - The world object that can be interacted with by an interactor. Interactables can be grabbed, scaled, rotated or whatever other actions can be created and plugged in.

> **Requires** the Unity software version `2018.3.10f1` (or above).
